# Classification-Diabetes
Diabetes classification using SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost with Kaggle dataset.

## 🩺 Classification Diabetes
This project aims to classify diabetes using machine learning techniques. A model was developed to predict a patient's diabetes status based on various medical features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, height, weight, and other health indicators.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the Kaggle Diabetes Dataset, which contains patient data with various health attributes and diabetes class labels. This dataset is commonly used for research and learning in the fields of data science and machine learning.

## 📊 Steps Taken
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzing data distribution

- Detecting missing values

- Understanding the characteristics and relationships between features

2. Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values

- Encoding categorical data

- Normalizing/standardizing numerical features

3. Modeling

Several machine learning algorithms are used and their performance is compared, namely:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Random Forest Classifier

- XGBoost Classifier

4. Model Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy

- Confusion Matrix

- ROC Curve (Multiclass)

- Learning Curve
